# CORONA-API

The CORONA-API project is a web application that provides real-time COVID-19 statistics for countries worldwide. It leverages data from a public API to display important health metrics such as total cases, deaths, recoveries, and new daily statistics, all in an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Real-time COVID-19 Data**: Fetches up-to-date statistics for any country.
- **Global and Country-Specific Stats**: Displays overall global cases and allows users to search for specific country data.
- **Comprehensive Data**: Shows total confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, recoveries, and daily updates for the selected region.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple, responsive design suitable for both desktop and mobile users.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across devices.
- **JavaScript**: Handles API calls and dynamically updates the DOM with fetched data.
- **Fetch API**: To make requests to the public COVID-19 API and retrieve real-time data.
- **COVID-19 API**: The external API that provides the COVID-19 statistics.
